<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<div class="para">
    <p>Trees are our best friends because they clean the air we breathe.
         Likewise, they also clean the water and soil and ultimately make the earth a better place. 
         It is also a fact that people who live near trees are healthier, fit, and happier than people who do not.</p>
   <p>Moreover, it is our responsibility to look after our friends who serve us in many ways. 
    Most importantly by saving plants, we are not doing any favor to plants but to ourselves only. 
    Because trees and plants life does not depend on us but our lives depend on them. </p>
